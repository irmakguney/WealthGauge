# 🚀 Live AI-Style Portfolio Manager — CLI Powered

**Because spreadsheets are boring, and you deserve *Wall Street AI vibes* in your terminal.** 

Welcome to the **Live Price Fetching Portfolio Manager** — a Google Colab-powered, no-GUI, pure-CLI experience that fetches *real-time* stock & crypto prices, calculates your profits/losses, and gives you AI-style human market insights without actually using a heavy ML model. 

Think of it as having a **financial analyst** in your pocket — except this one works for free, 24/7, and doesn’t take lunch breaks. 😎
